# MY472-Assignment-2
This repository contains my answers to Exercise 1 in Assignment 2  (MY472). The function was built to work with the 'population' dataset in tidry. The function takes two inputs, a dataset that includes population data for different countries across different years and a country name. It then calculates average population change between the first and the last year for which data is available for all countries, the difference in population change between the specified country and the average for all countries, and the rank of the country compared to all other countries in the dataset (either n. highest or n. lowest rate of population change based on whether population change was above or below the average). It then inserts the calculated results in a text chunk. This function may for instance be useful for a yearly report that takes up-to-date population figures and calculates population change against a baseline.
